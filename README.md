# Data Wrangling with dplyr - Cute cats, cute grammar

This tutorial will guide you through the basic grammar and functions of `dplyr` package in `R`.  
`dplyr` provides a set of tools to efficiently manipulate datasets. It belongs to the `tidyverse`, which is a a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying philosophym design and grammar.  
  
Knowing that data analysis is an iterative process, learning how to write **synthetic, fast and easy to read** code in`dplyr` is the best present you can give your *future self*. 
`dplyr`'s grammar is easy to write, explain, revise and mantain. It will help you save a *lot* of time later

The overarching goals of this tutorial is to fall in love with `dplyr` and to see some cute wild cats. The specific goals are:  
- Understand the logic of `dplyr` and the power of piping `%>%`  
- Explore the key verbs of `dplyr`'s grammar  
- Simulate a `dplyr` based workflow  

You will learn how to use the key verbs of `dplyr`, including `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `summarize()`, `rename()`, as well as their generalized `x_at()` and `x_all()` versions. We'll also touch on the `join` family of functions.  

Not only... We do this using a toy dataset based on the cutest wild cats ever!
